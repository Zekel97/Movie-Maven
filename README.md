# Movie Maven

#### Yet another movie library app

<br />

## Why?

I wanted to test my **development** and **project management skills** by designing and implementing a simple app. I expect it to
seem overkill by seeing the simplicity of the app itself but I wanted to push myself to respect a workflow and completely
handle the brief, organization, development and testing of the app.

## Tech used

I used **NextJS** with **Typescript** and **SCSS**.<br />
For the styling I was aided by **Tailwind**.<br />
The API connection was made using **Axios** and **ReactQuery**.<br />
I implemented **Prettier** to let it format and keep my code clean.<br />
For the testing process I used **Cypress** for E2E tests.<br />

## Why would you design it like this?

Because I wanted to pay homage to this car and the 90's vibe: <br />

## Can I see it without cloning the project?

Absolutely!<br />
